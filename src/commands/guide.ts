‚ñ∂Ô∏è üëæ Clan Raids üëæ
Clan raids are different than normal raids. First of all, they have chances to be shiny! Secondly, the movesets do not work like normal raids - each Pok√©mon will have moves defined by their type. (For example, a Pok√©mon that is :Ground: Ground and :Fighting: Fighting will have one :Ground: Ground move and one :fight: Fighting move.)

The type of move is defined by Atk. and Sp.Atk; if total Atk. is greater, moves will be physical. If total Sp.Atk. is greater, moves will be special. If your Pok√©mon is monotype, it will have both physical and special. Each moves is Base Power 100, Accuracy 100 and 5 PP.

Raids will start 5 minutes after you pay the fee to start and they will last 15 minutes or until you defeat them. It's not recommend to go in alone.

/clan start-raid - to start a clan raid, costs 100k coins 
\u3000/clan join-raid - to join the raid, costs 100k coins per person
\u3000/clan raid - continue fighting the raid every 10 seconds
\u3000/clan catch - use a premier ball to try to catch the raid pok√©mon

‚ñ∂Ô∏è üèØ **__Dojo__** üèØ 
Dojo is a similar feature to Gyms in Pok√©mon Go.

Starting at level 10, Clans will have a Dojo. You can add one Pok√©mon to your Clan's Dojo to protect it from other players attacking it. You will have 10 stamina and it will use 1 every time you fight. You get 1 stamina every 30 minutes.

When you attack a Dojo, it will be fighting a random Dojo and depending of the result of the fight you will earn points:
- 2 for fighting a Dojo
- 8 for defeating a Pok√©mon in a Dojo
- 1 for defending your Dojo

Every Sunday, rewards will be sent for the highest Dojo points.
- 1st place clan gets 1 shiny rare raid + 5 rarity gems for each member
- 2nd & 3rd place get 1 shiny raid + 3 rarity gems each
- 4th & 5th place get 1 rare raid + 2 rarity gems each
- 6th & below get 1 rarity gem each + dojo points x1000 in clan exp
